# Random Name Picker for prize giveaways

:pray: First, huge shout-out to [@icelam](https://github.com/icelam) for a great and simple name picker we could fork and use for the GitHub booth, now I'm using it for a special St Jude Play Live 2023 prize draw.

:rocket: This site is deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The Actions workflow pulls entrants from commenters of a GitHub Issue.

:sparkles: To enter the draw, head to the issues tab, select the campaign, and add a comment.
